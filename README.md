# Tips & Tricks for Google Search to return authentic results

Tips and tricks you can do to make Google Search return authentic seach results, ya know, what you're **actually** looking for; eliminate AI results in your queries once and for all1

## Quintessential Google Search Operators

--

The minus (-) operator: Excludes webpages that have a term or terms you specify. 

You can add multiple terms by adding quotation marks around the terms (eg. -"apple iphone").

For the purposes of removing AI content from queries, you can add these at the end of your query; -ai -ia -"stable diffusion" -"ai art" -lora. This should clean up the results well, but if you want to remove the obvious theft and pawning of art through platforms like etsy, redbubble, displate, etc, you can add this at the end of your query: -"add * cart" (or just -$ -â‚¬). 
> The star (*) symbol is known as a wildcard, which matches a word with any phrase. The prhase we set is "add to cart", but we replace "to" with the star operator just to make sure everything is caught, plus, wildcards don't take up query count (which i'll get to later). The minus operator can be used in conjunction with any other operator.

The site (site:) operator: Includes or excludes a website or domain you specify (eg. site:youtube.com -- will limit all results to the domain YouTube.com).

You can add the minus (-) operator in front of the site (site:) operator to exclude sites you DON'T want to see (eg. -site:reddit.com). 
> This goes far beyond just naming sites, since you can also limit queries to have a domain extension of your choosing (eg. site:.com).

Now, let's apply this to remove much of this AI filth.

Limiting the query to only have .com will remove a lot of the AI garbage, since a lot of AI sites use domains that end in .ai, .art, .co, .xyz, etc. 

In your query, add (site:.com) at the very end of your query to remove AI sites that use .ai, .art, .co, etc top level domains.

The quotation marks ("") operator: Searches for webpages that include the EXACT term or terms you specify; will not perform automatic stemming of phrases (eg. "run" will not search for "running", "ran", etc).

> Using quotation marks is very useful if you are looking for an exact term or phrase within a webpage (eg. "anime" digital art).

Can also be used in conjunction with the minus (-) operator to exclude multiple words or phrases from appearing in your queries (eg. -"midjourney art").

Quotation marks can also be used for other operators as well, such as: intext; intitle; allintext; allintitle; etc.

-- 

The before (before:) and after (after:) operator: Includes or excludes results before or after user specified dates (eg. before:2022, or after:2022).

Can be useful if you are looking for authentic artwork before this AI ordeal. 

Append before:2022 to the end of your query to achieve authentic results.
