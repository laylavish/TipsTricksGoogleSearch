## Quintessential Google Search Operators

The minus (-) operator: Excludes webpages that have a term or terms you specify. 

You can add multiple terms by adding quotation marks around the terms (eg. -"apple iphone").

For the purposes of removing AI content from queries, you can add these at the end of your query; -ai -ia -"stable diffusion" -"ai art" -lora. This should clean up the results well, but if you want to remove the obvious theft and pawning of art through platforms like etsy, redbubble, displate, etc, you can add this at the end of your query: -"add * cart" (or just -$ -â‚¬). 
> The star (*) symbol is known as a wildcard, which matches a word with any phrase. The prhase we set is "add to cart", but we replace "to" with the star operator just to make sure everything is caught, plus, wildcards don't take up query count (which i'll get to later). The minus operator can be used in conjunction with any other operator.

The site (site:) operator: Includes or excludes a website or domain you specify (eg. site:youtube.com -- will limit all results to the domain YouTube.com).

You can add the minus (-) operator in front of the site (site:) operator to exclude sites you DON'T want to see (eg. -site:reddit.com). 
< This goes far beyond just naming sites, since you can also limit queries to have a domain extension of your choosing (eg. site:.com).

Now, let's apply this to remove much of this AI filth.
